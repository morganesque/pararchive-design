# Pararchive Design

This repo is for all the source files for the page designs I created for the [Pararchive Project](http://pararchive.com).

I used [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) mainly to produce flat HTML pages which reflected the designs for different pages. I then pulled the different patterns into a styleguide which was used in the final production of the site.

The CSS is built on top of the excellent [inuit.css](https://github.com/inuitcss).

I used [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for automation so checkout the [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/morganesque/pararchive-design/blob/master/gulpfile.js) for more details on that.

The finished product which came out of the [Pararchive Project](http://pararchive.com) was called [Yarn](http://yarncommunity.com/).

Buon appetito!
